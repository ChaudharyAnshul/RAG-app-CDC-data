2021 Final Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) Success Rates	https://data.cdc.gov/Assisted-Reproductive-Technology-ART-/2021-Final-Assisted-Reproductive-Technology-ART-Su/cchw-gdwa	cchw-gdwa	Dataset	ART data are made available as part of the National ART Surveillance System (NASS) that collects success rates, services, profiles and annual summary data from fertility clinics across the U.S. There are four datasets available: ART Services and Profiles, ART Patient and Cycle Characteristics, ART Success Rates, and ART Summary. All four datasets may be linked by “ClinicID.” ClinicID is a unique identifier for each clinic that reported cycles. The Success Rates dataset contains success rates for ART cycles started during the year indicated. Since ART success depends on whether patients  are using their own eggs or donor eggs, success rates are included separately for these two groups. Success rates for patients using their own eggs are shown per intended retrieval, per actual retrieval, and per transfer. These success rates are reported as cumulative success rates, which take into account transfers that occur within 1 year after an egg retrieval. Since ART success depends on whether patients are using ART for the first time or had prior ART cycles, users can examine success rates for all “Patients using their own eggs” or for “Patients with no prior ART using their own eggs.” For new patients using ART for the first time, the success rates are also shown after 1, 2, or all intended egg retrievals during the reporting year. In addition, the average number of transfers per intended retrieval and the average number of intended retrievals per live-birth delivery are shown. Success rates for ART cycles that involve the transfer of embryos created from donor eggs or donated embryos are shown and are not cumulative. They are based on donor cycles started in the year indicated that had embryo transfers, regardless of when the donor eggs were retrieved. Success rates in this section are not presented by patient age group because previous data show that an intended parent’s age does not substantially affect success when using donor eggs or donated embryos. The success rates are presented by types of embryos and eggs used in the transfer. This dataset excludes cycles that were considered research—that is, cycles performed to evaluate  new procedures.

NVSS is a secure, web-based data management system that collects and disseminates the Nation's official vital statistics. Indicators from this data source have been computed by personnel in CDC's Division for Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention (DHDSP). This was one of the datasets provided by the National Cardiovascular Disease Surveillance System and presented on DHDSP’s Data, Trends, and Maps online tool. This tool was retired in April of 2024 and this dataset will not be updated. Contact dhdsprequests@cdc.gov if you need assistance with data previously included in this dataset. The data are organized by location (national and state) and indicator; NVSS mortality data include CVDs (e.g., heart failure). The data can be viewed by temporal trends and stratified by age group, sex, and race/ethnicity.	April 9, 2024
2021 Final Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) Summary	https://data.cdc.gov/Assisted-Reproductive-Technology-ART-/2021-Final-Assisted-Reproductive-Technology-ART-Su/9tjt-seye	9tjt-seye	Dataset	ART data are made available as part of the National ART Surveillance System (NASS) that collects success rates, services, profiles and annual summary data from fertility clinics across the U.S. There are four datasets available: ART Services and Profiles, ART Patient and Cycle Characteristics, ART Success Rates, and ART Summary. All four datasets may be linked by “ClinicID.” ClinicID is a unique identifier for each clinic that reported cycles. The Summary dataset provides a full snapshot of clinic services and profile, patient characteristics, and ART success rates. It is worth noting that patient medical characteristics, such as age, diagnosis, and ovarian reserve, affect ART treatment’s success. Comparison of success rates across clinics may not be meaningful because of differences in patient populations and ART treatment methods. The success rates displayed in this dataset do not reflect any one patient’s chance of success. Patients should consult with a doctor to understand their chance of success based on their own characteristics.	October 30, 2023

500 Cities: Local Data for Better Health, 2019 release	https://data.cdc.gov/500-Cities-Places/500-Cities-Local-Data-for-Better-Health-2019-relea/6vp6-wxuq	6vp6-wxuq	Dataset	This is the complete dataset for the 500 Cities project 2019 release. This dataset includes 2017, 2016 model-based small area estimates for 27 measures of chronic disease related to unhealthy behaviors (5), health outcomes (13), and use of preventive services (9). Data were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. The project was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information on a large scale for cities and for small areas within those cities. It includes estimates for the 500 largest US cities and approximately 28,000 census tracts within these cities. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to inform development and implementation of effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these measures include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data (2017, 2016), Census Bureau 2010 census population data, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2013-2017, 2012-2016 estimates. Because some questions are only asked every other year in the BRFSS, there are 7 measures (all teeth lost, dental visits, mammograms, pap tests, colorectal cancer screening, core preventive services among older adults, and sleep less than 7 hours) from the 2016 BRFSS that are the same in the 2019 release as the previous 2018 release.

This dataset is a de-identified summary table of vision and eye health data indicators from VSP, stratified by all available combinations of age group, race/ethnicity, gender, and state. VSP claims for VEHSS provides a convenience sample of vision insurance members representing approximately more than 1 in 4 of the U.S. population. VSP uses a web-based claims submissions system to collect and process claims. The denominator of the rates represents persons with VSP benefits as reported by employers, and is subject to some uncertainty.  VSP data for VEHSS include Service Utilization and Eye Health Condition indicators.  Certain ophthalmic conditions and procedures are covered by health insurance and are not covered by managed vision insurance, claims based eye disease prevalence may therefore be expected to undercount true prevalence.  Person level claims and person counts are not publically available.  Reported rates were suppressed for de-identification to ensure protection of patient privacy. Detailed information on VEHSS VSP analyses can be found on the VEHSS VSP webpage (link). Information on VSP data can be found on the VSP website (www.vsp.com).

All four datasets may be linked by “ClinicID.” ClinicID is a unique identifier for each clinic that reported cycles. The Success Rates dataset contains success rates for ART cycles started during the year indicated. Since ART success depends on whether patients are using their own eggs or donor eggs, success rates are included separately for these two groups. Success rates for patients using their own eggs are shown per intended retrieval, per actual retrieval, and per transfer. These success rates are reported as cumulative success rates, which take into account transfers that occur within 1 year after an egg retrieval. Since ART success depends on whether patients are using ART for the first time or had prior ART cycles, users can examine success rates for all “Patients using their own eggs” or for “Patients with no prior ART using their own eggs.” For new patients using ART for the first time, the success rates are also shown after 1, 2, or all intended egg retrievals during the reporting year. In addition, the average number of transfers per intended retrieval and the average number of intended retrievals per live-birth delivery are shown. Success rates for ART cycles that involve the transfer of embryos created from donor eggs or donated embryos are shown and are not cumulative. They are based on donor cycles started in the year indicated that had embryo transfers, regardless of when the donor eggs were retrieved. Success rates in this section are not presented by patient age group because previous data show that an intended parent’s age does not substantially affect success when using donor eggs or donated embryos. The success rates are presented by types of embryos and eggs used in the transfer. This dataset excludes cycles that were considered research—that is, cycles performed to evaluate new procedures.

Visual Acuity Loss:
Visual acuity loss prevalence estimates represent best-corrected visual acuity in the better-seeing eye and are included in rows where Category=’Measured Visual Acuity’.  Rows with Subgroup = ‘Any vision loss' represents any impairment or blindness of 20/40 or worse; rows with Subgroup = 'US-defined blindness' refers to the subset of vision loss that is 20/200 or worse.
Age Related Macular Degeneration:
The age-related macular degeneration (AMD) estimates represent AMD as measured with retinal imaging examination, and are included in rows where Category = ‘Age Related Macular Degeneration’.  The Subgroup ‘Vision threatening AMD’ includes patients with geographic atrophy, wet-form AMD, or choroidal neovascularization in either eye. The Subgroup ‘Non-vision threatening AMD’ includes patients with early or intermediate dry-form AMD defined as retinal pigment epithelium abnormalities or drusen ≥125 µm in the worse-affected eye, and do not have vision threatening AMD.
Diabetic Retinopathy:
The diabetic retinopathy (DR) estimates represent DR as measured with retinal imaging examination, and are included in rows where Category=’Diabetic Eye Diseases’.  The Subgroup ‘Vision threatening DR’ includes patients with severe non-proliferative DR, proliferative DR, and diabetic macular edema. The Subgroup ‘Non-vision threatening DR’ is defined as patients with mild-moderate non-proliferative DR or unspecified DR, and do not have vision threatening DR.
Glaucoma:
VEHSS Composite Prevalence Estimates for glaucoma are forthcoming. 
Age Groups:
The VEHSS Composite Prevalence Estimates are available by major age groups (All ages, ages 0-17, 18-39, 40-64, 65-84, 85+) and detailed (5-year) age groups, which are indicated by the text “by detailed age groups” in the ‘Indicator’ field. 
Prevalence Data Type:
These estimates are also available as crude (Data_Value_Type = ‘Crude Prevalence’) or adjusted data (Data_Value_Type=’Adjusted Prevalence).  Crude Prevalence is the estimate of the actual number and percentage of people living with each condition.  Adjusted Prevalence estimates are adjusted to match the national population by age, race/ethnicity, and gender.  Adjusted prevalence estimates can be used to help identify disparities in prevalence between geographic areas that are not explained by differences in demographic characteristics.

Data Sources:
Data sources for VEHSS Composite Prevalence Estimates include the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), the American Community Survey (ACS), the National Survey of Children’s Health (NSCH), the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), Medicare Fee-For-Service claims, the Transformed Medicaid Statistical Information System, MarketScan commercial insurance claims, the Health Resources & Service Administration’s Area Resources File, and published examination study results from the Baltimore Pediatric Eye Disease Study (BPEDS), the Chinese American Eye Study (CHES), the Eye Diseases Prevalence Research Group (EDPRG), the Los Angeles Latino E"	September 21, 2023

Data were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. The project was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. This is a filtered subset of the 500 Cities data that provides model-based small area estimates for 27 measures of chronic disease related to unhealthy behaviors (5), health outcomes (13), and use of preventive services (9). It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information on a large scale for cities and for small areas within those cities. It includes estimates for the 500 largest US cities and approximately 28,000 census tracts within these cities. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to inform development and implementation of effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these measures include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data (2017), Census Bureau 2010 census population data, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2013-2017 estimates.

PLACES covers the entire United States—50 states and the District of Columbia—at county, place, census tract, and ZIP Code Tabulation Area levels. It provides information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at four geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. PLACES was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. The dataset includes estimates for 36 measures: 13 for health outcomes, 9 for preventive services use, 4 for chronic disease-related health risk behaviors, 7 for disabilities, and 3 for health status. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to help develop and carry out effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates are Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2021 or 2020 data, Census Bureau 2010 population data, and American Community Survey 2015–2019 estimates. The 2023 release uses 2021 BRFSS data for 29 measures and 2020 BRFSS data for 7 measures (all teeth lost, dental visits, mammograms, cervical cancer screening, colorectal cancer screening, core preventive services among older adults, and sleeping less than 7 hours) that the survey collects data on every other year.

2017, 2019, 2021. This dataset contains estimates of the prevalence of visual acuity loss and major eye diseases generated using a Bayesian meta-analytic modeling approach that combines information from multiple data sources to produce comprehensive estimates of prevalence by age, race, and gender at the national, state and county levels. These composite prevalence estimates are the primary surveillance measures developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Vision & Eye Health Surveillance System (VEHSS).  
For more information about these estimates including summary tables and maps, methods, and links to related publications visit https://www.cdc.gov/visionhealth/vehss/estimates/index.html
To view this data in the VEHSS interactive data visualization application, visit https://ddt-vehss.cdc.gov/ and search for “VEHSS Composite Prevalence Estimate”.
Visual Acuity Loss:
Visual acuity loss prevalence estimates represent best-corrected visual acuity in the better-seeing eye and are included in rows where Category=’Measured Visual Acuity’.  Rows with Subgroup = ‘Any vision loss' represents any impairment or blindness of 20/40 or worse; rows with Subgroup = 'US-defined blindness' refers to the subset of vision loss that is 20/200 or worse.
Age Related Macular Degeneration:
The age-related macular degeneration (AMD) estimates represent AMD as measured with retinal imaging examination, and are included in rows where Category = ‘Age Related Macular Degeneration’.  The Subgroup ‘Vision threatening AMD’ includes patients with geographic atrophy, wet-form AMD, or choroidal neovascularization in either eye. The Subgroup ‘Non-vision threatening AMD’ includes patients with early or intermediate dry-form AMD defined as retinal pigment epithelium abnormalities or drusen ≥125 µm in the worse-affected eye, and do not have vision threatening AMD.
Diabetic Retinopathy:
The diabetic retinopathy (DR) estimates represent DR as measured with retinal imaging examination, and are included in rows where Category=’Diabetic Eye Diseases’.  The Subgroup ‘Vision threatening DR’ includes patients with severe non-proliferative DR, proliferative DR, and diabetic macular edema. The Subgroup ‘Non-vision threatening DR’ is defined as patients with mild-moderate non-proliferative DR or unspecified DR, and do not have vision threatening DR.
Glaucoma:
VEHSS Composite Prevalence Estimates for glaucoma are forthcoming. 
Age Groups:
The VEHSS Composite Prevalence Estimates are available by major age groups (All ages, ages 0-17, 18-39, 40-64, 65-84, 85+) and detailed (5-year) age groups, which are indicated by the text “by detailed age groups” in the ‘Indicator’ field. 
Prevalence Data Type:
These estimates are also available as crude (Data_Value_Type = ‘Crude Prevalence’) or adjusted data (Data_Value_Type=’Adjusted Prevalence).  Crude Prevalence is the estimate of the actual number and percentage of people living with each condition.  Adjusted Prevalence estimates are adjusted to match the national population by age, race/ethnicity, and gender.  Adjusted prevalence estimates can be used to help identify disparities in prevalence between geographic areas that are not explained by differences in demographic characteristics.

Data Sources:
Data sources for VEHSS Composite Prevalence Estimates include the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), the American Community Survey (ACS), the National Survey of Children’s Health (NSCH), the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), Medicare Fee-For-Service claims, the Transformed Medicaid Statistical Information System, MarketScan commercial insurance claims, the Health Resources & Service Administration’s Area Resources File, and published examination study results from the Baltimore Pediatric Eye Disease Study (BPEDS), the Chinese American Eye Study (CHES), the Eye Diseases Prevalence Research Group ("	July 27, 2023

Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates are Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2021 or 2020 data, Census Bureau 2010 population estimates, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2015–2019 estimates. The 2023 release uses 2021 BRFSS data for 29 measures and 2020 BRFSS data for 7 measures (all teeth lost, dental visits, mammograms, cervical cancer screening, colorectal cancer screening, core preventive services among older adults, and sleeping less than 7 hours) that the survey collects data on every other year. These data can be joined with the 2019 Census TIGER/Line place boundary file in a GIS system to produce maps for 36 measures at the place level.

It includes estimates for the 500 largest US cities and approximately 28,000 census tracts within these cities. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to inform development and implementation of effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these measures include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data (2017), Census Bureau 2010 census population data, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2013-2017 estimates.

PLACES covers the entire United States—50 states and the District of Columbia (DC)—at county, place, census tract, and ZIP Code Tabulation Area levels. It provides information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at 4 geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. PLACES was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2020 or 2019 data, Census Bureau 2010 population estimates, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2015–2019 estimates. The 2022 release uses 2020 BRFSS data for 25 measures and 2019 BRFSS data for 4 measures (high blood pressure, taking high blood pressure medication, high cholesterol, and cholesterol screening) that the survey collects data on every other year. These data can be joined with the 2019 Census TIGER/Line place boundary file in a GIS system to produce maps for 29 measures at the place level. An ArcGIS Online feature service is also available for users to make maps online or to add data to desktop GIS software. https://cdcarcgis.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=3b7221d4e47740cab9235b839fa55cd7	August 25, 2023

This dataset includes 2015, 2014 model-based small area estimates for 27 measures of chronic disease related to unhealthy behaviors (5), health outcomes (13), and use of preventive services (9). Data were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. The project was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information on a large scale for cities and for small areas within those cities. It includes estimates for the 500 largest US cities and approximately 28,000 census tracts within these cities. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to inform development and implementation of effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these measures include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data (2015, 2014), Census Bureau 2010 census population data, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2011-2015, 2010-2014 estimates. Because some questions are only asked every other year in the BRFSS, there are 7 measures from the 2014 BRFSS that are the same in the 2017 release as the previous 2016 release.
